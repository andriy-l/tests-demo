JUnit 4 has introduced a new feature called parameterized tests.
Parameterized tests allow a developer to run the same test over
and over again using different values.
There are five steps that you need to follow to create a parameterized test.

   1. Annotate test class with @RunWith(Parameterized.class).

   2. Create a public static method annotated with @Parameters
   that returns a Collection of Objects (as Array) as test data set.

   3. Create a public constructor that takes in what is equivalent
   to one "row" of test data.

   4. Create an instance variable for each "column" of test data.

   5. Create your test case(s) using the instance variables as the source of the test data.

The test case will be invoked once for each row of data.
